# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, it's Shakoor!
## From the Martial Arts ring to the world of Data Science  
Iâ€™ve spent nearly a decade leading, teaching, and analyzing performance to improve outcomes. Now, I apply that same focus and curiosity to data. Skilled in Python, SQL, and machine learning, I love turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.
